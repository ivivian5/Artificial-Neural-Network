-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Run:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    python3 main.py
    
(Note) needs user input for the attributes of plants that is need classification
    after the model is trained.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumptions:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    training file has 150 lines of data where each line is comprised of the
        attributes in order of Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal 
        width, and Class.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Artificial_Neural_Network.py - Uses the training data to train the model
                using the back-propagation algorithm with hidden layers.
    ...............................................................................
        main.py - Reads in training data to give model to train and then prompts 
                user for input of attributes of iris plant to be classified using
                artificial neural network model.

Solution Structure:

The ANN model first preps by shuffling the data into training, validation, and 
testing sets. I use a 0.6/0.2/0.2 ratio respectively because this is small dataset. 
Then I set the layers to include some hidden layers and the weights randomly. I did 
some testing and determined the number of hidden layers through experimenting.

When I train the model I run it for a user specified max number of runs, but cut it
off early if I find that the validation data accuracy shows that the model is being
overtrained. Each run builds a model from the previous weights and improves the
weight values to predict more accurately after each iteration of forward propagation
by offsetting bias with backwared propagation on the difference between what the
model predicts and our desired class for the plant. This combination of forward and
backward propagation is run for each node in our training set before we test our
model on the validation test. Finally we test our model on the final testing set
which determines our accuracy of our model in predicting the iris class types for
a plant with the given attributes. This testing accuracy can be seen to be always
above 0.93, and stays around 0.95-0.97 for the majority of runs. Each run of the
model will produce different results as the model randomly chooses which data point
will be used in each set (training, validation, and testing) as well as the weights
being randomly chosen from the start may have a effect to how the model trains to
identify the class of the plant.

Finally, the user input of determining a plants classification based on its
attributes does pretty well, but can be seen does much worse in differentiating
the versicolor and viriginia classifications. If I were to change this assignment
I would want to add how confident the model is in its prediction.
